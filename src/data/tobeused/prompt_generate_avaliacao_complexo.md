## TAREFA

Crie uma prova de múltipla escolha com **exatamente 20 questões** baseada no documento `knowledgeBase` fornecido. A prova deve avaliar a compreensão, aplicação e análise dos conceitos apresentados.

## REGRAS E DIRETRIZES PARA GERAÇÃO

1.  **Fonte do Conteúdo:** Todas as questões, opções corretas e incorretas devem ser **estritamente derivadas** do conteúdo dos `knowledgeNuggets` e `potentialMisconceptions` do documento `knowledgeBase`.
2.  **Contexto Clínico:** Formule as perguntas dentro de **cenários clínicos** realistas e plausíveis para a prática médica, tornando-as problemas a serem resolvidos.
3.  **Resposta Correta:** A opção correta de cada questão deve ser baseada diretamente em um ou mais `knowledgeNuggets`.
4.  **Distratores:** As opções incorretas (distratores) devem ser plausíveis e baseadas nos `potentialMisconceptions` associados ao conceito. Não crie informações aleatórias.
5.  **Pista (Hint):** Para cada questão, crie uma pista curta (1-2 frases). A pista deve guiar o raciocínio do aluno, ativando o conceito-chave necessário para responder, mas **NÃO deve revelar a resposta**. Use perguntas ou lembretes conceituais.
6.  **Explicação (Explanation):** Forneça um feedback detalhado para cada questão, explicando por que a resposta correta é a melhor escolha e por que as outras opções estão incorretas, referenciando o conceito subjacente.
7.  **Balanceamento:** Distribua as questões para cobrir uma variedade de `conceptId` da base de dados, garantindo uma avaliação abrangente. Priorize questões que avaliem os níveis de Bloom de **"Aplicar"** e **"Analisar"**.
